                           <p> Basic programming knowledge is helpful but not mandatory to get started. Many IoT platforms (like Arduino and Raspberry Pi) have beginner-friendly tutorials and ready-to-use libraries that simplify programming. Additionally, tools like Node-RED allow visual programming for IoT projects.
